              for the freedom of Hyderabad State from the yoke of Nizam’s regime, post 
              independence the fulcrum of socio-political-development movements of this 
              region had been SB Education Society. SB, the centennial institution, is

             Before independence, ‘Marathwada’ was a part of the ‘Hyderabad State’, 
             which was under the rule of the ‘Nizam.’ The medium of education was ‘Urdu’, 
             and teaching in ‘Marathi’ was considered a challenge by the Nizam’s government. 
             Despite such adverse and difficult circumstances, in 1915, visionary founders
              ‘Adv. Shri. Panditrao (Anna Saheb) Pargaonkar’, ‘Adv. Shri. Rajarampant 
              Rajchandra Pol’, ‘Shri. Vasant Balwant Vasishth’, and’ Shri. Digambardasji Chaudhary’ 
              obtained permission from the Nizam Government to provide education in Marathi and took 
              steps to awaken a national spirit among students, thus laying the foundation of the 
              ‘Shri Saraswati Bhuwan Education Society’ in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (Maharashtra). 
              Notably, in 1916, when girls could not even imagine stepping out of their homes, we took the
              progressive and enlightened decision to start the ‘Sharda Mandir Kanya Prashala- ‘a school for 
              girls’, to commence girls’ education.

              <p className="text-justify">
                The founders of our institution were committed to values and the moral framework, and this 
                tradition continues to till date. One of the former Secretaries of the institution and Member 
                of Parliament Late Bhauseheb Vaishampayan made relentless efforts for the institution’s expansion 
                in rural area. The modern architect of the institution were freedom fighters of the Hyderabad 
                Liberation Movement. The former president of the institution Late Govindbhai Shroff was honoured 
                with the ‘Padma Vibhushan’. The institution has steadfastly maintained the crucial principle of not 
                turning education into a commercial enterprise while promoting noble human values. The staff and 
                employees of our society are not merely workers but are educational activists and our collaborators.
